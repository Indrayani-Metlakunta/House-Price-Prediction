# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost.

## Overview

The goal is to build a model to predict house prices using the **California Housing** dataset. This project helps real estate and finance stakeholders make informed decisions by providing accurate price estimates.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing:** Uses the California Housing dataset, processed with Pandas for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Insights through visualizations like histograms and scatter plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Model:** XGBoost algorithm is employed for regression, known for high accuracy in predicting complex relationships.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance evaluated using metrics like R-squared and mean absolute error, along with a scatter plot to visualize predictions vs. actual prices.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `gh repo clone MYoussef885/House_Price_Prediction`
2. Install dependencies or use Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for house price prediction using machine learning techniques and the California Housing dataset.
